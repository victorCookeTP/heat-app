## HEAT APP - Howdy English Assessment Task

Initial English Assestment task for candidates using AI to create questionnaire and correct the answers provided by the candidate.

## Structure

The project consists of two folders, `heat-back` for the back end created with NodeJs & Express and `heat-from` for the frontend created with React & Next

## Getting Started

First, from the main folder, run the server:

```bash
cd heat-back

yarn
# or
npm install

yarn dev
# or
npm dev

```

The backend should start listening at port 4000 [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.

Secondly, from the main folder, run the client:

```bash
cd heat-front

yarn
# or
npm install

yarn dev
# or
npm dev

```

The Next app should start listening at port 3000 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment variables

Both the frontend and backend has an example `.env.development` with the variables needed to run the app, check the real values with a code owner to spin your local environment!
